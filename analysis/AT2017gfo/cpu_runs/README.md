This is the analysis that Peter did, and here I copy pasted the entire contents of his run.

On the Potsdam machines, Peter's runs were at: `/home/enlil/ppang/Projects/AT2017gfo_chemical_tf/inference/inference/Bu2022Ye_uniform_iota`

His models (`svd_path`) were at `/home/enlil/ppang/Projects/AT2017gfo_chemical_tf/inference/tensorflow_model`
